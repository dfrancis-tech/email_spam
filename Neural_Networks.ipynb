The true labels (y_test) are converted to integers (0 or 1). Finally, the classification report is printed for the test data, providing a comprehensive summary of the model's performance in classifying spam emails on the test dataset. The classification report includes metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and support for both classes (spam and not spam)."
